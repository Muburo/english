Vacation? You mean that there's a job situation that you can task freely, and free space, and there are places where you can meet with the client and colleague. All right, in my idea, I prefer and preparing for the working space, because working environment is important for doing a good job. In my experience, when I want to concentrate on some important tasks, I need it to be quiet. In that case, my seat is are really loud around here. So I want to move to the some kind of box. That is concentrate box. As long as I'm in this box, no one talk to me. It's really comfortable and which helps me concentrate on finishing tasks. So, the environment is really crucial for doing a good job. That's why I prefer employing the working station. The company should do it more and more to get a better environment.
