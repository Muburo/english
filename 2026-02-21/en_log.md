There are several things I'm into recently. But what's the most ones are two things. The first, I'm really into badminton. I took up about playing badminton about six months ago. And actually, today, I'm going to play badminton in the badminton circle. Badminton is a really exciting sport. But it's really difficult. And whenever I play it, I get frustrated because I can't play the way I want it. But it's OK. Sometimes, my smash hits the opponent. I'm really that's really vigorous me and sometimes I catch the shuttle shuttle yeah that feel good so good so badminton is one thing the next thing is AI agent like Claude I was really amazed by Using the capability of air agent like gold code, codex, and things like that. Happy New Year. So, actually, this week, I dream in China. This week is a Chinese national holiday or New Year holiday. So I spent my whole time using the AI code code, analyzing my data, and creating the new report, and trying the file coding. So I'm learning that GitHub and other tools to use more efficiently. That's a little bit different, but I have the AI agent has great potential to change the world, I believe. So, to sum up, those are the two things I'm really into these days. Playing badminton and trying out new technologies like code code.
