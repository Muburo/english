# My University Circle Memories

When I was a school university student, I belonged to the valuable circle named Anko. That was the circle. They loved drinking alcohol and play Bible, seriously. I spent all my time doing the valuable and throwing game, and playing Marjan. Do you know Marjan? This is a Chinese board game. It's very interesting. That circle has the opportunity to take a trip five times each year. Literally, we will create the event. We use also all our power. Dunking, Mansai, and some kind of game and things like that. We prepared for three months with that. So at the grade of three, we are the center of the circle. So we spent all our time running the event, doing the activities. Yeah, it was really busy, but it brings me a lot of memories. So, yeah, my young days, that was my great memory of my life.
