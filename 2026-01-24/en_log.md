My ideal lifestyle after retiring job is that I wanted to pursue my idea. I want to be alive that I can bring my ideas into real life. Because this is the most important thing for me. So after retaining my job, I keep pursuing my life. I read my lot of books, watching movies, and then I create my idea. So I want to bring my ideas into practice like creating the movie with AI and creating music and I'm now really interested in I'm really interested in creating a new app with closed code maybe in 30 years or 40 years I don't know but At that time, I want to learn new technologies at this time, so I want to challenge to see how to create, what interesting things I can create. So after returning my job, I want to pursue my own life.
