All right. It is really important. There are several points to understand customers clearly. All right. I strongly believe that especially two important things. Here's the reason I think so. The first, having a hypothesis is crucial. If you don't have the hypothesis to talk with the client, the hearing and meeting will be meaningless. If you have hypothesis, you can realize the gap between your hypothesis and the customer's needs. But if you don't, you don't understand the customer's career. So having the hypothesis is crucial before you meet with prior second point is you have the enough and experience and knowledge about the customer industry the experience and knowledge is key to understanding the customer together deeply if you don't have that if you don't have that then you differently fully understand the customers. In that case, and in my experience, I've worked in the automation industry for over seven years, but my manager worked in 30 years, and he have born expertise. So when I meet with a client of my own, I understand a client a bit, but With my boss, the bosses understand the customers really deeply. And the customers really emphasize and satisfied with that. So knowledge and experience is important. So having the hypothesis and having the experience and knowledge, this is my idea.
