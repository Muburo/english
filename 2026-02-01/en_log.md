# My Strong Points

My strong point? All right. There are several things. First, consistency is one of my strong point. For instance, I make it a hard point to go to bed early and wake up early. I've been keeping up this habit over five years. And last year, I've decided to run every morning. And then I've been keeping up this routine for one year. So I can... Yeah, I have this strong point. If once I decide to do something, I have a really confident to keep continuing. This is my strong point. The second thing, the curiosity. I have a strong curiosity about something. Now I'm really into AI, so I'm testing with AI for various things like a close call and the journey and of such a bit is. Now I want to replace the easy task or my regular routine to AI. My idea is AI. Replace the things AI can do to AI. The strong curiosity is my strong point. In conclusion, the consistency and curiosity, yeah, it's my... I have a confidence a little bit.
