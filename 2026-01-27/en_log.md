The condition I look for the job has several things. Most important thing is this something I can be passionate about in the company. I will keep motivated when the something important task is in. Even if it's a high salary, if there is no thing I am interested in, my motivation takes no side. So one important thing is there is something I can be passionate about. Second thing, the company has company's value aligned with my own. If the value is not different between companies and me, it's like a disaster. My motivation is going to be done differently. So the second point is the company's values align with mine. And the third reason is that the place is near my house. No, no, no, no. On the second thought, the company gives me an option for doing things to an extent. Doing something, I'm really interested. I'm really strong. My strong point is self-management. Discrepancies are not discrepancies. Discreate is very important. Thank you.
