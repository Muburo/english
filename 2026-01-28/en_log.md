# My Morning Routine

Okay then, let me show you my daily routine in the morning. I'm a really early, early bird, honestly. 4:30 a.m. After that, I take a short time walk outside to play around with cats. Yeah, there are two cats I've been caring for. My name is Napi and Cookie. It takes about 10 minutes. After that, returning to my place, I clean up my room for 5 minutes. And then, when I'm making a coffee, I do a quick throw up five times. After that, I started my learning routine. And now, I'm learning the GitHub and closed course to create my program and work more efficiently, make my work more efficiently. It takes about one hour. And after that, I will go to the gym. Gym is really near my place. It takes about 5-3 minutes on first. At this place, I will run every 30 minutes with protein nail. I am keeping up for this routine for 4 months straight now. This is my morning routine. The moment I finished all of this routine, I had to do the office and start working. This is my routine.
