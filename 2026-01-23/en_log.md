It depends on the situation. But in my opinion, it's better to eat out. There are several reasons about that. The first, eating out is very useful. Because he don't need to put out dishes, silver wires after dinner. After dinner, after eating. That's really way too convenient. So you don't worry about the zoning out. The second reason is that the restaurant has several vibes. An acoustic vibe, romantic vibe, and things like that. That vibe helps us to communicate with smoothly. So you can talk about a lot with your friends, colleagues, and co-workers. Yeah, honestly, the vibe is very important. For those reasons, I basically recommend leaving art with friends. But sometimes, it's very important to eat it. Because cooking together or you can talk down and calmly is crucial to deep communication. So, it depends on the situation. But in general case, I truth is involved with my friend.
