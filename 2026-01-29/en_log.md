# My Favorite Day Off

My most favorite date is Saturday. And my day off is the weekend. So it means Saturday and Sunday. On my day off, I usually, I deliberately try to work on new projects or new tasks I can usually do during the day week. So in my and lately, I've been really into experimenting with AI, especially CloudPort. And I want to try out new things. The CloudPort really launched a new technology named skills. I really, this technology makes has a great potential to change the world because using skills I can modify AI with technique. Usually only people know. For example, if you teach AI with skills like creating the website or making a document in a good design, such skills If you could verbalize this technology. If you could verbalize the technology, the AI can learn that. After that, AI can develop the document, website, like a thing that professional make of making. In addition, you can use many skills 100, 1000, 10,000, so Saturday can enable me to try the same. So I love Saturday the most.
