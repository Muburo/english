# Weekends vs Weekdays Off

Oh, it's a good question. In my younger days, I prefer weekend holidays. Because a friend of mine has always the weekend holidays. So... But in Japan, the residual industry has another holiday system. They tend to have the holiday. on Tuesday or Wednesday. In that case, the friends, other friends, don't align with the schedule. So the residual industry men can rarely hang out with friends when they are in university. So it's very hard. Yeah, I really agree with that. But And now, I've changed completely my mind. Because my friends have another life. They are having family, children, and living in the abroad, another place. So they are living their own life. So we don't have much time playing with my friends. For now, I want to take off rest on my weekdays because that case can enable me to further not only cheap, but also spacious, creative. So now, my conclusion is that in my younger days, I prefer weekends, holidays. But now, in my 40s, I prefer weekdays, holidays. That's my idea.
