# Credit Card Is the Best Way to Pay

I think that the credit is the best. There are some reasons for my opinion. Because, about five years ago, I loved using the cash. Yeah, cold cash. But at the moment, I used the credit card. like Beibei, Flipkart, and Flying Pay. Things like that in Japan. My world has completely changed. If you use the cold cash, small cash, it's really annoying. Hey, how much is that? It's 1055 yen. I will pay 1,100. All right. All right. I'll give you the another 42 yen. Oh, the 42 yen is annoying. But which card is not necessary to generate the small cash. And in addition, and now I'm living in China. China has a great country to develop the no cash, no cashing system. It's really seriously very convenient. I can use the WeChat and Alipay Jifubo whenever I buy things, even if it's an extremely local store. So it's really convenient. I want Japanese people to know this benefit, because Japanese people are really conservative. There are many comforted people when it comes to using the crypto card. So in conclusion, I definitely crypto card is the best way to pay things.
