The heaviest thing in my work was that at my previous job, I had to prepare for my presentation in just a short time. Besides, I didn't have enough experience for that, so I ended up waking up lake, especially at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. and making the materials and investing the information. After that, I had to give a presentation to the client. That was a really tough experience as ever before. Bottom line. While I didn't have enough experience, I had to quit presentation. It isn't enough time. That means each experiment is done lot of stress and mental damage. I have been spending this time for about two years. These two years have really severe time. But this experience It really made me... A lot of gold for me.
