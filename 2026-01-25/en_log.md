Okay, then. The things I want to do while I'm alive. There are several things. First, I want to know how much I can close to the next level I can get when it comes to speaking English. I'm now having been studying English for five years, but I'm not... high level so I just simply know if I keep learning for 10 years 20 years even over 40 years what level I can get and now I can I'm not a fluent in English at all but if I study for 20 years 40 years maybe I can get like a native speaker I just want to know the answer The second thing I want to create my own world Now with the advancement of AI I can create a picture music and movies But creating those is very important It is very simple But the important thing is to create own this world it's really difficult um but I want to challenge to yeah it's take my time and challenge myself to be so in conclusion the first important thing is keeping in English and I want to know the answer how much everything Yeah, but granted, I have to create my own world.
