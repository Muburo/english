I used to think that small folk was pointless and meaningless. But now, my change has completely changed. The reason is that I thought that nowadays, it is said that luck plays an important role. Or not, it is said that small folk plays an important role. on giving luck luck. Because when you talk with someone for small talk, you can discover something. Or the person you talked with discovered, Oh, your interesting gifts? Okay, then I have a very great friend for that. Let me introduce to you for him. Then you get the challenge. Or talking with someone, you discover the great idea. And then you can get a good result for doing that. In other words, a small talk is not pointless but a great opportunity to discover something so now and more talk is really benefic so I make it the point to have time for more talking more talk with someone but you shouldn't a lot of time, but with other people. It's okay for just 10 minutes or 30 minutes in a day.
