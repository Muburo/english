To maintain work-life balance, I do several things. First, I make it a habit to run every morning before work 30 minutes every day. It's very important to feel calm. My work is very busy, so my feelings sometimes is up and down. When being down, the moment I learn. After learning, my mind is keeping the flat line. So yeah, learning makes me feel calm. It's a very important habit. And after that, I intentionally try new things and new technologies. Now, I'm trying the new AI agent, cloud code, codex, anti-gravity, and things like that. Experience, new experience. Give me a new energy or insight of doing things, doing something. That kind of experience gives me that power. So it's a very important habit. Finally, what matters most is keep my sleep and awake time consistent every day. Sleeping is crucial for everything. When I sleep less, my motivation and capability are very hard. So sleeping is important than anything.
