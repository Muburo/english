I prefer both traveling on traveling abroad and traveling in domestic. But I want to have an experience that I would have never usually normally get. In that means, traveling abroad is better. Because going to the abroad have a great and insight. gives me an experience I've never had before, like eating food, eating a different food, and touching with new culture and languages. That kind of experience gives me a lot of insight. In the end, which leads to creating a new idea, may change my life. So going to the abroad is better. But on the other hand, I want to have the experience to travel. That is, just doing what I have to do in the moment. In this way, for example, I'm really sick to my routine. But while traveling, I want to do it without my routine because that's changed my mind and ideas. So in this meaning, the place is not important. So yeah, in conclusion, I prefer going to abroad due to the different experience, but In domestic is okay. It was okay because it's different time. Thank you.
